## Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Properties with Location Relationships

// Fetch properties with connected location data
const response = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'properties' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1) // Include connected location objects

const properties = response.objects as Property[]
```

// Fetch singleton trust metrics
const response = await cosmic.objects
  .findOne({ type: 'trust-metrics', slug: 'platform-statistics' })

const metrics = response.object as TrustMetric
```

### Filtering Properties by Location

```typescript
// Query properties by location ID (object relationship)
const response = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ 
    type: 'properties',
    'metadata.location': locationId // Query by ID, not nested properties
  })
  .depth(1)
```
